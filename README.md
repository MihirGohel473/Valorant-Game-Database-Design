# Valorant Game Database Project

This project involves the design and implementation of a relational database for the popular game **Valorant**. The goal was to simulate a structured backend for storing various in-game elements such as agents, weapons, maps, player stats, and match history.

## Features

- ✅ Designed a complete **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** for the game data.
- ✅ Converted the ER model into a **normalized relational schema** (up to 3NF).
- ✅ Populated the database with **large-scale synthetic data** to simulate real-world usage.
- ✅ **Deployed and tested** the schema and data using **PostgreSQL**.
- ✅ Enabled complex SQL queries to retrieve gameplay insights and performance stats.

## Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- Draw.io / dbdiagram.io (for ER modeling)
- Python (for data generation)
